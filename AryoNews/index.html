        <h3>The struggles of Aryo</h3>
            <p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span class="bigletter">A</span>ryo's journey through the world of mathematics</a> has been fraught with hurdles. His struggles range from grasping to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">fundamental concepts</a> coping with the demands of higher-level math courses. Like many students, Aryo has faced the uphill task of building a strong foundation in mathematics, with each new concept dependent on the understanding of the previous one. The lack of a solid base has left him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">feeling lost and frustrated</a> at times.
            Furthermore, the abstract nature of mathematics has proven to be a formidable adversary for Aryo. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Translating</a> real-world problems into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">mathematical equations</a> and formulas has been a constant source of challenge, leading to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">doubt and confusion</a>. Despite his determination, Aryo's battle with mathematics has often felt like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">uphill climb</a>.
            </p>

        <h3>Aryo's Resilience and the Path Forward</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Despite the formidable struggles, Aryo's determination shines through. He refuses to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">give up</a> on his pursuit of mathematical proficiency. His story serves as an inspiration, highlighting the importance of support systems, effective teaching methods, and individualized approaches to education.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Aryo's journey</a> is a reminder that the road to mathematical excellence is rarely smooth. However, with the right resources <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">and a</a> supportive community, Aryo and countless others like him can overcome these challenges and thrive in the world of mathematics. His story is a testament to the power of resilience and determination in the face of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">academic adversity</a>.        
            </p>

        <h3>Aryo's Message to Fellow Strugglers</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">As Aryo continues his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">mathematical journey</a>, he has a message for students who may find themselves in similar situations. "Never be afraid to ask questions and seek help," he advises. "Mathematics is a vast ocean, and it's okay to feel lost sometimes. The key is to keep swimming, keep learning, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">never give up</a>."
            Aryo's story serves as a reminder that struggles in education are not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">signs of inadequacy</a> but rather opportunities for growth. With determination, support, and the right mindset, individuals like Aryo can conquer even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">the most formidable mathematical challenges</a>. His journey is an inspiring narrative of resilience and the pursuit of knowledge, shedding light on the struggles many students face and the unwavering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">spirit that propels</a> them forward.

    Vi skal lage en forside som ligner "arstechnica.com".
    Use "Classes" as much as possible. 
    The page you create should begin with a heading, 
    contain a sub-heading and end with the first paragraph after the second sub-heading
    The author should be given an "id" as well,
    for example 'jtimmer' in this example. 

    til dummy text = lorem ipsum
    Dette siden skal ha:
        title/ main heading
        sub-title
        journalist name + date
        image + photographer
        paragraph(s)
        sub-heading
        paragraph
        … and more sub-headings and paragraphs if relevant

    Gjøremål:

	• Fikse footer
	• Legge til link fra og til begge sider (kan være button, og/-eller en flex box navbar)
	• Legge til teskt til bilde og kildehenvisning til bilde. Picture element E
	• Fikse random farge oransjer med faktiske linker/(fjerne det?)
	• Skalere siden (padding problemer)
	
	• Accesebillity
