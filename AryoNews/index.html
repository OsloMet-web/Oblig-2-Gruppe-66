    Vi skal lage en forside som ligner "arstechnica.com".
    Use "Classes" as much as possible. 
    The page you create should begin with a heading, 
    contain a sub-heading and end with the first paragraph after the second sub-heading
    The author should be given an "id" as well,
    for example 'jtimmer' in this example. 

    til dummy text = lorem ipsum
    Dette siden skal ha:
        title/ main heading
        sub-title
        journalist name + date
        image + photographer
        paragraph(s)
        sub-heading
        paragraph
        … and more sub-headings and paragraphs if relevant
